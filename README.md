## Introduction
"MADE IN JAPAN"  
A synonym for high quality product that once swept the world  
Now it is a word rarely heard  
Where did the past fame go?  
As the countries called "emerging countries" grew rapidly,  
has the Japanese technology that created "MADE IN JAPAN" lost its competitiveness?  
No, it has not  
Japan still leads the world in fields such as automobiles and medicine  
The base of these fields is supported by Japan's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  
Japan's technological and organizational strength is unparalleled in the world  
The past 30 years of low growth was caused by the Japanese people's lack of outward-looking consciousness  
They are reserved, lacking in presentation skills, and not good at foreign languages  
They have missed out on many business opportunities around the world  
In other words, there are many competitive technologies that just haven't seen the light of day  
That is why we support "MADE IN JAPAN" to show its true value  
It is the RESTART of Japan like a START-UP to increase their value dynamically.  
We will communicate the attractiveness to people all over the world,  
and meet their needs with valuable technologies  
to realize the development of the world as the STAR of HOPE
